Line 400-429: Added my implementation of a doubly indirect block. 
I first check if bn is pointing to the doubly indirect block.
If it is, I check is that block is empty or not, if it is I allocate
it using balloc. Then I get the second level block pointer using bread
and store the second level data into a. I then calculate the index of the 
second block and then check if the third level is empty or not using the 
index. If it is, I allocate it using balloc and then write to it using 
log_write. I then release the second level buffer and get the third level
block pointer using read and get the data into a. After calculating the 
third level index we again allocate a block if we need to and then write 
to it, ultimately releasing the third level buffer and returning addr.
